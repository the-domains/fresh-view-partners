Located in Napa Valley, Fresh View Partners, LLC is a strategic advisory firm focused on the success of wineries and other closely-held businesses.
 

We work in concert with you to develop a profitable and sustainable competitive advantage by focusing on all aspects and complexities of operating and managing a small business to meet specific goals. We offer our clients a full complement of sustainable business solutions that really work. We offer a fresh approach -- a Fresh View. 

A powerful and rewarding strategy for your business success is to bring in advisors that complement your goals and strengths, while assisting you to overcome your weaknesses. Larger businesses can turn to their Board, can gather all of their executives, but the leader of a small to mid-size company usually doesn't have those options. Sometimes having a sophisticated sounding-board to bounce ideas around may be all that is needed. This is exactly where we fit in. 

As trustworthy confidants, the Advisors at Fresh View Partners support you as experienced teachers, mentors, consultants, and even a Board of Directors for you and your team. 

Fresh View Partners provides the opportunity for owners and leaders of small businesses to get all the help they need within budget. 

Contact us to discuss and explore how we can help you accomplish your goals.
